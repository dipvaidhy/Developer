            Think and Grow Rich is based on Hill's earlier work The Law of Success, claims to be the result of more than
            twenty years of study of many individuals who had amassed personal fortunes. Hill studied their habits and
            drew some 16 "laws" to be applied to achieve success. Think and Grow Rich condenses them, providing the
            reader with 14 principles in the form of a "Philosophy of Achievement".
            The main theme of the book is that anyone can achieve success and wealth by following a certain set of
            principles. Hill identifies these principles as the "13 Steps to Riches," which include developing a
            positive mental attitude, setting clear and specific goals, developing a plan to achieve those goals, taking
            action, and maintaining a strong belief in oneself and one's capabilities.

            April of 2022 marks a 25-year milestone for the personal finance classic Rich Dad Poor Dad that still ranks
            as the #1 Personal Finance book of all time. And although 25 years have passed since Rich Dad Poor Dad was
            first published,readers will find that very little in the book itself has changed ― and for good reason.
            While so much in our world is changing a high speed, the lessons about money and the principles of Rich Dad
            Poor Dad haven’t changed. Today, as money continues to play a key role in our daily lives, the messages in
            Robert Kiyosaki’s international bestseller are more timely and more important than ever.

            In The Atlantic, Derek Thomson describes Thiel's book as possibly the best business book he has ever read.
            In his review article, he wrote: "Peter Thiel's new book, Zero to One, shines like a laser beam. Yes, this
            is a self-help book for entrepreneurs, bursting with bromides and sunny confidence about the future that
            only start-ups can build. But much more than that, it's also a lucid and profound articulation of capitalism
            and success in the 21st century economy" and "it's surprising in a wonderful way just how simple Zero to One
            feels. Barely 200 pages long, and well lit by clear prose and pithy aphorisms, Thiel has written a perfectly
            tweetable treatise and a relentlessly thought-provoking handbook"

            Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness doing well with money isn?t necessarily about what you
            know. It?s about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. How to manage
            money, invest it, and make business decisions are typically considered to involve a lot of mathematical
            calculations, where data and formulae tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world, people don?t make
            financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where
            personal history, your unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled
            together. In the psychology of money, the author shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people
            think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life?s most important matters.
